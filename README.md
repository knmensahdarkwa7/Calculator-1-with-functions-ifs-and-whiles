# Calculator-1-with-functions-ifs-and-whiles
HI, I'm Kwadwo Mensah (silence):)
I've been working with pythn for a few yrs now 
and I'm now really getting the hang of it and this the first of many

So basically, this is a simple calculator which uses a while and
alot of if statement to perform the most basic of calculations
